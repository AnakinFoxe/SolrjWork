SolrjWork
=========
1. Solr 4.x is required. But the version should be no greater than 4.7.x, since
Java 6 will not be supported afterwards.
2. Java Machine Learning Library (0.1.7) is required. 
    - Can be downloaded at: http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/
    - Need to manually import the jar file since the project is a Maven
    project.
